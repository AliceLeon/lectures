Postal Machine Decision (2018)
https://www.instagram.com/p/BrfjYK-FaQt/
Each parcel carries two addresses, one on front, one on back, each with a unique barcode waiting to be scanned. Postal machines decide which direction the parcel takes, depending on which side is "up". Some parcels bounce around the postal system for weeks, traveling back and forth between Berlin, Leipzig, Halle, Cologne and Brussels. Some take a more direct route.
