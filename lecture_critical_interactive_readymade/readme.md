**[$10,000 Sculpture (In Progress)](https://web.archive.org/web/20120410011543/http://www.caleblarsen.com/projects/10000-sculpture-in-progress/)**, 2009

*"The $10,000 Sculpture (in progress) visually consists of a standard dollar bill acceptor found in soda and candy vending machines. This device has become a symbol of self-serve retail transactions. In this instance, it is installed seamlessly into a plain white wall with no clues to inform the viewer as to the nature of the piece. Nor does it suggest what might happen if they were to insert a dollar bill. [...] The work exists primarily at the moment of contribution by the viewer. It is a continual charity, or more cynically, a form of panhandling. It asks for money, and offers nothing (by way of direct response) in return."*

**[When Laughter Trips at the Threshold of the Divine](http://www.idealcities.com/when-laughter-trips-at-the-threshold-of-the-divine/)**, 2008

*"With equal nods to Minimalism's aesthetics and consumerism's supermarket maximalism, the project places a fully functioning automatic sliding door in the middle of a public park, offering the everyday as a folly for play, re-experience and reflection on neutered thresholds."*

### Bjørn Karmann & Tore Knudsen

**[Project Alias](http://bjoernkarmann.dk/project_alias)**, 2018

*"Alias is a teachable 'parasite' that is designed to give users more control over their smart assistants, both when it comes to customisation and privacy. Through a simple app the user can train Alias to react on a custom wake-word/sound, and once trained, Alias can take control over your home assistant by activating it for you. When you don't use it, Alias will make sure the assistant is paralysed and unable to listen by interrupting its microphones.*

*Alias acts as a middle-man device that is designed to appropriate any voice activated device. Equipped with speakers and a microphone, Alias is able to communicate and manipulate the home assistant when placed on top of it. The speakers of Alias are used to interrupt the assistance with a constant low noise/sound that feeds directly into the microphone of the assistant. First when Alias recognises the user created wake-word, it stops the noise and quietly activates the assistant with a sound recording of the original wake-word. From here the assistant can be used as normally."*

**[Postal Machine Decision](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrfjYK-FaQt/)**, 2018 

*"Each parcel carries two addresses, one on front, one on back, each with a unique barcode waiting to be scanned. Postal machines decide which direction the parcel takes, depending on which side is "up". Some parcels bounce around the postal system for weeks, traveling back and forth between Berlin, Leipzig, Halle, Cologne and Brussels. Some take a more direct route."*

### Julijonas Urbonas

**[Euthanasia Coaster](http://julijonasurbonas.lt/euthanasia-coaster/)**, 2010

*The Euthanasia Coaster is an art concept for a steel roller coaster designed to kill its passengers. In 2010, it was designed and made into a scale model by Julijonas Urbonas, a PhD candidate at the Royal College of Art in London. Urbonas, who has worked at an amusement park, stated that the goal of his concept roller coaster is to take lives "with elegance and euphoria". It is a ride to the death. The seven loops or inversions put the human body under such stress that it causes the brain to be starved of oxygen, as the heart simply cannot push blood against the enormous g-forces. John Allen, who served as president of the Philadelphia Toboggan Company, inspired Urbonas with his description of the "ultimate" roller coaster as one that "sends out 24 people and they all come back dead".* 

*“Euthanasia Coaster” is nothing but a falling trajectory, curved and tangled in such a way that would leave nobody apathetic, neither the passenger, nor the spectator. It is a prop for non-existent horror movie, a real fiction, a black humour scenography, social sci-fi design, the world's most extreme ride, a mourning sculpture, a monument for the end of the carousel evolution, a gravitational weapon, the very last trip...*

The Euthanasia Coaster would kill its passengers through prolonged cerebral hypoxia, or insufficient supply of oxygen to the brain. The ride's seven inversions would inflict 10g on its passengers for 60 seconds – causing g-force related symptoms starting with gray-out through tunnel-vision to black-out and eventually g-LOC (g-force induced loss of consciousness).
